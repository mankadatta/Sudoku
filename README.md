# Sudoku
Project Description:
The Sudoku Solver and Puzzle Generator is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to play Sudoku puzzles, solve existing ones, and generate new puzzles. Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also known as regions) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Features:

1.Interactive Sudoku Board: The application will feature an interactive 9x9 grid that allows users to input numbers and navigate through cells effortlessly.

2.Validation: The user's input will be validated to ensure that the rules of Sudoku are followed, and incorrect entries will be highlighted or denied.

3.Solving Algorithm: The application will include a Sudoku-solving algorithm that can solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels. The algorithm will employ a backtracking approach to find the solution.

4.Puzzle Generator: Users will be able to generate new Sudoku puzzles of different complexities at the click of a button. The generator will ensure that the puzzles are solvable and have a unique solution.

5.Difficulty Levels: The puzzles generated will have different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to cater to users of varying expertise.

6. Responsive Design: The interface will be designed to work smoothly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Technologies Used:

1. HTML: To create the basic structure of the web page, including the Sudoku grid and user interface elements.
2. CSS: To style the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.
3. JavaScript: To implement the Sudoku-solving algorithm, user input handling, validation, puzzle generation, and game logic.

Additional Considerations:

1. The project should have a user-friendly and intuitive interface to ensure a smooth user experience.
2. Code modularization and proper comments should be used to enhance code readability and maintainability.
3. The application should provide clear instructions on how to play Sudoku and use the various features.
4. Testing the application thoroughly and handling potential edge cases will be important for a robust implementation.

Potential Extensions (optional):

1. Multiplayer mode: Add the capability for users to play Sudoku collaboratively or compete against each other.
2. User accounts: Implement user account functionality to track progress and high scores over time.
3. Social sharing: Enable users to share their solved Sudoku puzzles on social media platforms.
4. Advanced solving techniques: Implement additional solving algorithms like "Naked Pairs" or "X-Wing" to improve solving capabilities.
